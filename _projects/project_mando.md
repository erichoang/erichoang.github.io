The project's primary objective is to detect vulnerabilities in the source code and bytecode of smart contracts, both at the coarse-grained contract-level and fine-grained line-level, with a high degree of accuracy. The core engines of the MANDO project are constructed on the foundation of state-of-the-art heterogeneous deep graph learning methodologies.
