We propose the SoChainDB framework that facilitates obtaining data from blockchain-powered social networks since accessing and collecting data from these social networks is not easy. It often requires in-depth blockchain knowledge, which is not the focus of computer science and social science researchers. To show the capacity and strength of SoChainDB, we crawl and publish Hive data - one of the largest blockchain-based social networks. We conduct extensive analyses to understand the insight of Hive data and discuss exciting applications, e.g., blockchain games extracted from the decentralized network by SoChainDB. Besides, the rich and valuable data from decentralized social networks also opens up several new directions for the research community to advance knowledge about human behavior.
