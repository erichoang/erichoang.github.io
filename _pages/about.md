Dr. Hoang H. Nguyen (Eric Hoang) is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Urban Informatics and Progress, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, from August 2024. His current work focuses on federated learning and develops modern solutions to enhance trajectory prediction at traffic intersections using decentralized data sources while maintaining privacy and security standards.

Dr. Nguyen was a doctoral researcher at the L3S Research Center, Leibniz University Hannover, from 2020 to 2024. He was also a visiting student and later a research associate at the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, from 2016 to 2018. In 2017, he received his Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Vietnam, and earned his Dr. rer. nat. (equivalent Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science from Leibniz University Hannover, Germany, in 2024.

Dr. Nguyen has over ten years of experience in Software Engineering and Graph Mining in both industry and academia. He collaborated with researchers and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) across more than fifteen countries to develop platforms that expedite investigative processes and support LEA decision-making. He also built frameworks for managing blockchain-powered social network data and identifying vulnerabilities in blockchain smart contracts.

His research interests include Federated Learning, Graph Mining, Machine Learning, Graph Learning, Social Network Analysis, Program Analysis, Software Security, and Blockchain Smart Contracts.
