Dr. Hoang H. Nguyen (Eric Hoang) joined the L3S Research Center at Leibniz University Hannover as a doctoral researcher from 2020 to 2024. Previously, he was a visiting student and then a research associate at the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, from 2016 to 2018. In 2017, he received his Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Vietnam, and earned his Dr. rer. nat. (equivalent Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science from Leibniz University Hannover, Germany, in 2024.

Dr. Nguyen has over 10 years of experience in Software Engineering and Graph Mining in both industry and academia. At the L3S Research Center, he collaborates with researchers and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) from more than fifteen countries and territories to develop new platforms that expedite investigative processes and support LEA decision-making. He also builds frameworks for storing and retrieving blockchain-powered social network data and detecting vulnerabilities in blockchain smart contracts.

His research interests include Graph Mining, Machine Learning, Social Network Analysis, Program Analysis, Software Security, and Blockchain Smart Contracts.
